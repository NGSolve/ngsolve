    "The `h1amg` preconditioner works for symmetric, scalar problems with nodal degrees of freedom. \n",

    "\n",
    "The coarsening of degrees of freedom is steered by the strength of connections between dofs, one may think of a network of resistors. For this, one finds edge-based weights $w_E$ such that the energy norm is equivalent to the weighted sum of squared differences:\n",

    "$w_E$ is the edge-weight (the conductivity of each resistor), and $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the vertex numbers of the end-points of the edge $E$. The right hand side is a norm represented by a surrogate matrix $\\tilde A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to determine the edge-weights $w_E$. If one has access to element-matrices (instead of the assembled matrix), one has better possibilities. One may compute Schur complements with respect to all edges of each element, which gives a surrogate matrix for each element. Then sum up the weights (conductivities) of all elements sharing the edge.\n",
