Using Jupyter notebook
======================

`Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ provide an interactive way to work with Netgen/NGSolve.

If you are using Anaconda, Jupyter is already installed. Make sure to have Anaconda with Python 3.6 installed.

Using the Python package manager pip you can install Jupyter via

.. code:: bash

   pip3 install jupyter

On Windows you just start pip. Make sure to install Jupyter for Python 3.x.

Now, download the first NGSolve Jupyter notebook :download:`poisson.ipynb</../py_tutorials/poisson.ipynb>`, and start

.. code:: bash

   jupter notebook poisson.ipynb

Step though the notebook by pressing "Shift-Enter" for every cell. A separate visualization window will pop up showing the generated mesh and computed solution.
