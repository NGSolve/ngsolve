## Reporting issues

If you have a problem using Netgen/NGSolve consider asking a question in our [forum](https://ngsolve.org/forum).

If you found a bug create an issue in the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/NGSolve/ngsolve/issues). Please be as specific as possible, issues with a reproducible minimal failing example will get more attention than unspecific one liners :)

## Contributing patches

We love and want to encourage community engagement and will review and accept patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few steps to follow:

On your first contribution, to clear any legal questions, we ask you to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.pdf). Generally you have to sign this only once for Netgen or NGSolve. Please send the signed agreement to <joachim.schoeberl@tuwien.ac.at>.

Place a pull request on GitHub. From there we will pull it into our internal testing environment and, if approved, merge it into the main codebase.

If you have any questions feel free to ask on the [forum](https://ngsolve.org/forum).
